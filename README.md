About Telect

Telecet is a web responsive application that makes tracking your shows easy and straight to the point.

This application is also my capstone project for BrainStation's full-stack bootcamp.
The project task was to create a fullstack application with react in 2 weeks.

Tools used for Telect:

Front-End:
Create-react-app, react-router, and SASS.

Back-End:
Node/Express backend API with JWT for auth, and Knex to query a MySQL database.

Installation:

Set up the frontend:

1. Run npm i from inside the client directory:

   $ cd ../telect
   $ npm i

2. Start the react app:

   $ npm start
