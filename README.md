About Telect

Telecet is a web responsive application that makes tracking your shows easy and straight to the point.

This application is also my capstone project for BrainStation's full-stack bootcamp.
The project task was to create a fullstack application with react in 2 weeks.

Telect was made using the following tools:

Front-End:
Create-react-app, react-router, and SASS.

Back-End:
Node/Express backend API with JWT for auth, and Knex to query a MySQL database.

Installation:

Follow the below steps to run a local instance of Telect.

You will need npm, node and MySQL.

1. Clone or download my repo.

2. Create a new database called telect.

3. Install server dependencies:

   Run npm i from inside the server directory.
   $ cd telect-server.
   $ npm i.

4. Run Migrations:

   $ npm run migrate.

6. Start the server:
